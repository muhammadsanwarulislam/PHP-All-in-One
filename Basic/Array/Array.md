**Here are some of the most commonly used array functions in PHP:**
* **array_map()** — Applies the callback to the elements of the given arrays, array_map() returns an array containing the results of applying the callback to the corresponding value of array (and arrays if more arrays are provided) used as arguments for the callback.
* **array_product()** — is a built-in PHP function that calculates the product of all the elements in an array.
* **array_chunk()** — array_chunk() is a built-in PHP function that is used to split an array into smaller arrays of equal size. It takes two parameters: the first parameter is the array that needs to be split, and the second parameter is the size of each chunk.
* **array_push()** — Push one or more elements onto the end of array.
* **array_pop()** — Pop the element off the end of array.
* **current()** — Return the current element in an array.
* **end()** — Set the internal pointer of an array to its last element.
* **next()** — Advance the internal pointer of an array.
* **prev()** — Rewind the internal array pointer.
* **reset()** — Set the internal pointer of an array to its first element.
* **sizeof()** — is an alias of the count() function, which returns the number of elements in an array or the number of properties in an object.
