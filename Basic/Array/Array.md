**Here are some of the most commonly used array functions in PHP:**
* **array_map()** — Applies the callback to the elements of the given arrays, array_map() returns an array containing the results of applying the callback to the corresponding value of array (and arrays if more arrays are provided) used as arguments for the callback.
* **array_product()** — is a built-in PHP function that calculates the product of all the elements in an array.
* **array_chunk()** — array_chunk() is a built-in PHP function that is used to split an array into smaller arrays of equal size. It takes two parameters: the first parameter is the array that needs to be split, and the second parameter is the size of each chunk.
* **array_filter()** — is a built-in PHP function that filters the elements of an array using a callback function. It takes two parameters: the first parameter is the array to filter, and the second parameter is the callback function to use for filtering.
* **array_fill()** — is a built-in PHP function that creates an array containing a specified number of elements, all with the same value. It takes three parameters: the first parameter is the starting index of the array, the second parameter is the number of elements to create, and the third parameter is the value that each element should contain.
* **compact()** — Create array containing variables and their values.
* **in_array()** — Checks if a value exists in an array.
* **array_key_exists()** — Checks if the given key or index exists in the array.
* **array_push()** — Push one or more elements onto the end of array.
* **array_pop()** — Pop the element off the end of array.
* **current()** — Return the current element in an array.
* **end()** — Set the internal pointer of an array to its last element.
* **next()** — Advance the internal pointer of an array.
* **prev()** — Rewind the internal array pointer.
* **reset()** — Set the internal pointer of an array to its first element.
* **sizeof()** — is an alias of the count() function, which returns the number of elements in an array or the number of properties in an object.
