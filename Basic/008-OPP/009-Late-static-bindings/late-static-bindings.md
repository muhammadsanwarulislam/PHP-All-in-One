## Introduction

Late static binding is a feature in PHP that allows a class to reference its called class in a context of static inheritance. It enables a subclass to reference its own class dynamically, even when methods are inherited from a parent class.

## How Does it Work?

In PHP, when a method is declared as `static`, it means it belongs to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. Prior to PHP 5.3, the `self` keyword was used to refer to the class where the method was defined. However, this caused issues when methods were overridden in subclasses.

Late static binding introduced the `static` keyword, which resolves the class based on the runtime context rather than the definition context. This allows subclasses to override methods and still reference themselves correctly.

## Example

```php
class ParentClass {
    public static function whoAmI() {
        echo static::class;
    }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
}

ParentClass::whoAmI();  // Output: ParentClass
ChildClass::whoAmI();   // Output: ChildClass
```
## Advantages

* Flexibility: Late static binding enables dynamic resolution of static methods, providing flexibility in method overriding within class hierarchies.

* Code Reusability: It promotes code reusability by allowing subclasses to override methods while maintaining correct references to themselves.

* Enhanced Readability: Late static binding ensures that methods referenced statically resolve to the appropriate subclass, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
