# Polymorphism in PHP

This README provides an overview and explanation of polymorphism in PHP.

## Introduction

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in software design by allowing methods to be called on objects without needing to know their specific class.

## How Does it Work?

In PHP, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding. Subclasses provide their own implementation of methods defined in the superclass. When a method is called on an object, the runtime environment determines the actual class of the object and executes the appropriate method.

## Example

Consider a common scenario of a superclass `Animal` with subclasses `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`. Each subclass may have its own implementation of a method called `makeSound()`. Through polymorphism, you can call `makeSound()` on any `Animal` object without knowing its specific type.

```php
class Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        echo "Animal makes a sound";
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        echo "Dog barks";
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        echo "Cat meows";
    }
}

$dog = new Dog();
$cat = new Cat();
```

$dog->makeSound(); // Output: Dog barks
$cat->makeSound(); // Output: Cat meows

In this example, Dog and Cat objects are treated as Animal objects due to polymorphism, allowing the makeSound() method to behave differently based on the actual type of the object.

## Advantages
* Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for code reuse and promotes flexibility in software design.
* Readability: It enhances code readability by enabling the use of common interfaces and abstractions.
* Extensibility: New subclasses can be added without modifying existing code, promoting extensibility and maintainability.

## Conclusion
Polymorphism is a powerful concept in PHP that promotes flexibility, extensibility, and code reuse. By allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly, it simplifies software design and enhances maintainability.
