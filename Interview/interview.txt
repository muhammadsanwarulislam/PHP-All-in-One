There is a list of interview questions which i have been facing till now.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. About HTTP status code.
        -> 1xx informational response
        -> 2xx success(Most common)
            -> 200(success)
            -> 201(create)
            -> 202(Accepted)
        -> 3xx redirection
        -> 4xx client errors(Most common)
            -> 401 (Unauthorized)
            -> 403 (Forbidden)
            -> 404 (Not Found)
        ->5xx server errors

    2. Difference between PUT and PATCH Request
        -> put request can be use in order update an existing resource or put request can use create a resource which is call upsert
        -> whenever we send put request we have to send whole the body resources in the request payload

        -> patch request basically just change few attributes existing resource

    3. Difference between print and echo
        ->echo has no return value, echo can take multiple parameters and echo is marginally faster than print

        ->print has return value of 1 so it ca be used in expressions

    4. Difference between abstract class and interface
        ->interface can contain only abstract method
        ->interface can not contain constructor. it will return such kind of error "Fatal error: Interface function A::__construct() cannot contain body"
        ->interface all function must be public. if the method protected then it will return such kind of error "Fatal error: Access type for interface method A::demo() must be omitted"
        ->interface can support multiple inheritence
