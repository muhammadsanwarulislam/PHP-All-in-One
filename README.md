## Object

**What is an Object** If you look at the world around you, youâ€™ll find many examples of tangible objects: lamps, phones, computers, and cars. Also, you can find intangible objects such as bank accounts and transactions.

All of these objects share the two common key characteristics:
1. State
2. Behavior

For example, a bank account has the state that consists of:
1. Account number
2. Balance

A bank account also has the following behaviors:
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw

PHP objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects because they consist of state and behavior.

An object holds its state in variables that are often referred to as properties. An object also exposes its behavior via functions which are known as methods.
