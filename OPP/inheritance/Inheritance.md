## Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a concept in object-oriented programming where a new class can be created by inheriting the properties and behaviors of an existing class. The existing class is called the base class or parent class, and the new class is called the derived class or child class. Inheritance allows the derived class to reuse code from the base class, and also to add new properties and behaviors.

**Important key points**
   * In inheritance we can't access private property from extends class.
   * We can't decrease visibility of property.
   * We can't change the method signature.
   * In ```construct()``` method signature can be modify.
